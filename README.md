# youtube_search
## Project Goal
To make an API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.

## Requirements
- A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.
- A basic search API to search the stored videos using their title and description.
- Add support for supplying multiple API keys so that if quota is exhausted on one, it automatically uses the next available key.
- Make a dashboard to view the stored videos with filters and sorting options (optional)
    
## How to <i>Setup</i>
 - Follow the instructions on [docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install docker on your system.
 - Install docker compose - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
 - Clone the repository and navigate inside it
 - Create `.env` file inside fampay_test folder
    Example:
    ```CELERY_BROKER_URL='amqp://rabbitmq'
    CELERY_TASK_DEFAULT_QUEUE='fampay'
    GOOGLE_API_KEYS=APIKEY_1,APIKEY_2,APIKEY_3,....,APIKEY_N
    QUERY_STRING=cricket
    DB_NAME='postgres'
    DB_USER='postgres'
    DB_PASSWORD='wDnfWovh4uf3'
    DB_HOST='db'```
    
  You can copy and paste the above contents to `.env` file and replace APIKEY_1,APIKEY_2,...,APIKEY_N with your Google api keys. 
  And also replace DB_PASSWORD value, you refer [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) for database password
 - Run `docker-compose up -d --build`

The application will come up @http://localhost
